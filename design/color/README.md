# Why do I need to think about color?

If you are designing *any* product then you *must* consider color!

<br>

# What does color mean?

How are colors perceived? How do they make us feel? If I am promoting a food delivery feature, how might color influence my customer? If my app is primarily for data entry and retrieval, does color even matter?

Consider usage of the color **red**. It, along with **orange**, is typically used in communication design as a caution or warning. :warning: :no_entry_sign: :fire: :collision:

# What about color contrast?

Dark text on a light background is a winning combination for large swathes of text. But what about other elements such as callouts and headings?

How do you feel about...

**Aside from the obvious** crimes of *high-contrast* design, there is also a backlash against the trend toward *low-contrast* design. The **Nielsen Norman Group** (world leaders in user experience research) published [Low-Contrast Text Is Not the Answer](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/), citing designs; such as apple.com, which at the time (2015) was using low-contrast text design. The author considers the usability of low-contrast text and how we might look back on this trend.

# Tools for deciding on a color scheme

I'll admit it - I'm not a world class designer but I do have a few tools in my kit to help me!

Remember the westmacsapp? My inspiration pic which lead my design thinking during the initial Mood Boarding phase...

I uploaded this image to [ColorFavs](http://www.colorfavs.com/) and in return was provided with this color scheme...

This was a great first step for deciding colors in the layout, however, I will still need a darker color for the headings and main text (we'll see).
