# Style Guides

## What are we learning here?

* Purpose of a style guide.
* Style guides found within organisations.
* Typical format and contents of a style guide.
* Creation of a simple style guide from an example product.

# What is a style guide?

A **Style guide** is an organisational document which specifies the stylistic rules and conventions which should be followed when publishing information and documents.

This includes...

* Use and placement of logos and branding
* Font selection
* Words, phrases and grammar

Imagine a large organisation (or even a small one). A style *guide* helps everyone to maintain   consistent branding, look and feel for all all products (web, print, etc).

When negotiating a new design project, one of your questions should be *"Does your organisation have a style guide?"*. If there is no *official* style guide then that's your chance to **value add**.

# Why use a style guide in a project?

Often times you will be *required* to follow an organisational style guide, however, for a new product or business, a style guide is...

* :+1: It's a design tool!
* :+1: Style guides can be shared with your team and your clients during planning.
* :+1: Style guides can form part of the final project brief, promoting consensus, agreement and assist with acceptance testing.

# What does a style guide look like?

As you will see in the discussion below, style guides can be varied in their presentation and content. At a minimum, a text document created using a standard word processor is appropriate for the task.

# United Nations Web Style Guide

The [United Nations Web Style Guide](https://www.un.org/styleguide/) includes not only the style guide but also many justifications for their choices.

For instance, the guide specifies the *Roboto* font and then goes on to state..

*"Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types."*

The **Color Scheme** guide gives prescriptive advice regarding when and where color may be used, for instance...

:point_right: *"Blue is used for page elements but NOT for text nor backgrounds."*
